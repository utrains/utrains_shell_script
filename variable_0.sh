## ---------- variables allow to contain values that we want to use several times in our scripts -----------------

#in our script, Serge is used 4 times, so good scripting practice requires us to create a variable to hold the Name. 
# If the name is no longer the same, we will only have to change the value of our variable

name=Angel

echo "$name is a very hard working guy"
echo "The manger says, he will hire $name in his new team wherever he goes"
echo "$name likes to show off because the manger loves him"
echo "$name will always be available when they need him"
